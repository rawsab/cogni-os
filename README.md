> For my **MYP Personal Project**, a **prototype operating system** was design and developed, aimed at assisting children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in using desktop operating system interfaces more efficiently while minimizing the effects of autism-related hypersensitivity. The project was targeted towards children of age 7 to 12 diagnosed with Level 2 ASD.
#####
The **programming language Swift** was used to create a functional prototype of the user interface. Throughout the research process, I worked with **Alan Smerbeck**, an associate professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, as well as **Sarah Jimenez**, a Board Certified Behavior Analyst and special-ed teacher.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Project

1. Download the `cogni-os` directory to local device (macOS 10.15.4 or later required)
2. Open the following executable: `cogni-os/CogniOS App Contents/Contents/MacOS/CogniOS Final`

## üìù Research Highlights
### Primary Research Takeaways:

- Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who have cognitive impairments may experience confusion and distress when presented with an excessive number of items on-screen.
- Due to potential deficits in reading skills, the use of icons and color schemes can enhance visual memory and facilitate navigation.
- Children with severe autism often become distressed during abrupt focus shifts; therefore, slow and streamlined transitions are essential.
- Research indicates that children with severe autism typically respond better to audio stimuli than to text-based information.
- Children with autism frequently find certain fonts, such as Helvetica and monospace fonts, easier to read compared to other typefaces.
- It is more challenging for children with severe autism to detect chromatic targets on a chromatic background; however, they can more easily identify chromatic targets on a grayscale background.
- Hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli is commonly associated with autism, and colors like yellow may be perceived as sensory-overloading.
