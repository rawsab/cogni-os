> For my **MYP Personal Project**, I designed and programmed a **prototype operating system** aimed at assisting children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in using desktop operating system interfaces more efficiently while minimizing the effects of autism-related hypersensitivity. The project was targeted towards children of age 7 to 12 diagnosed with Level 2 ASD.
#####
The **programming language Swift** was used to create a functional prototype of the user interface. Throughout the research process, I worked with **Alan Smerbeck**, an associate professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, as well as **Sarah Jimenez**, a Board Certified Behavior Analyst and special-ed teacher. 

Undertaking this interdisciplinary project resulted in the successful development of both knowledge-based and transferable personal skills such as structured and modular programming, graphic design, organizational skills, and efficient time management.
