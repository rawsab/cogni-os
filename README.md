> For my **MYP Personal Project**, I designed and programmed a **prototype operating system** aimed at assisting children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in using desktop operating system interfaces more efficiently while minimizing the effects of autism-related hypersensitivity. The project was targeted towards children of age 7 to 12 diagnosed with Level 2 ASD.
#####
The **programming language Swift** was used to create a functional prototype of the user interface. Throughout the research process, I worked with **Alan Smerbeck**, an associate professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, as well as **Sarah Jimenez**, a Board Certified Behavior Analyst and special-ed teacher. 

Undertaking this interdisciplinary project resulted in the successful development of both knowledge-based and transferable personal skills such as structured and modular programming, graphic design, organizational skills, and efficient time management.

## üìù Research Highlights
### Main takeaways from my research:

- Children with cognition-affecting autism can get confused and become distressed if there are too many items on the screen.
- They may have weaker reading skills, so icons and colours can allow for improved visual memory and easier navigation.
- It is possible for children with severe autism to become distressed when switching focus, therefore slow and streamlined transitions are required.
- Children with severe autism typically respond better to audio than text.
- Children with autism commonly find some fonts, such as Helvetica and monospace fonts, easier to read than other fonts.
- It is more difficult for children with severe autism to detect chromatic targets on a chromatic background, but it is easier for them to detect chromatic targets on a grayscale background.
- Hypersensitivity is closely related to autism, so the colour yellow can be perceived as sensory-overloading.
